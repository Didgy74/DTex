[x] = Done
[-] = In Progress
[o] = Cancelled

To do list for 0.1v
[o] - Make documentation explaining the memory type distinction, how mips are defined etc...
[x] - Change features to be opt-out by default
[ ] - Test that all feature-configurations work as intended
[x] - Add ReadStream loading paths
[x] - Add "load from file path" loading paths
[x] - Repair buffer loading paths to be a wrapper for the stream-based one
[ ] - Revise GL enum -> Texas enum conversions
[ ] - Revise Vulkan enum -> Texas enum conversions
[x] - (?) Add memory-type enum for Allocator interface to differentiate between image-data memory and working memory.
[ ] - Revise KTX writing code
[ ] - Fix the error-handling made by Texture class.
[x] - Maybe use C runtime FILE for "load from file path"?
[x] - Define the Texas::ResultValue copy constructor.
[ ] - Setup proper comments for the public interface.
[ ] - Fix the loading paths that are divived in 2 parts, the no allocator involved stuff.
[ ] - Fix license

After 0.1v
[-] - Better support for reading PNG
	Add support for interlaced images
	Add support for 16-bit color channels
[ ] - Find better name for Texas::OpenFile, maybe UnclosedFile? Maybe something with the word "Temp"?
[ ] - Add support for texture streaming 
[ ] - Add opt-out functionality for STL -> Texas type conversions
[ ] - Move examples into it's own Git repo
[ ] - Find out how small a file could possibly be and still be valid. Helps with early validation.
[ ] - Flesh out how validation should work, exceptions vs. asserts
[ ] - Investigate if there is any point to somehow undef'ing the assert in public headers
[ ] - When the implementation is in the header, like templated types, maybe move implementation into it's own header under detail?
[ ] - Investigate whether the library should have a TextureLoader struct that stores settings for loading a file, and also a method to actually load it.
[ ] - Get started on some CI. Compilation tests, compare loaded files to other libs...
[ ] - Maybe add operator*, operator-> and operator bool to ResultValue<T>?
[ ] - Maybe find a better name for Dimensions and "baseDimensions"? Alternatives: Size (dataSize for internalbuffer size), Extent
